# MachineLearning_classification
Python implementation of various machine learning algorithms for the classification analysis

***

Description
-----------
1. Python implementation of the classification models, namely logistic regression, k-nearest neighbours, random forest, gradient boosting, and artificial neural network.

2. The grid search to tuning each model and k-fold stratified cross validation are also presented

3. Sample patent data is also presented.

Prerequisites
-------------
1. Python (the codes in this repository are developed using Python verison 3.6.6)
2. You need several external packages, and they are mentioned in the python file.
